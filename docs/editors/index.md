# Editor Setup

Configure your favorite editor to work seamlessly with Spark A1's intelligent assistance.

## Supported Editors

Spark A1 works with various code editors through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Choose your editor below to get started:

### Supported Editors

- [**Cursor**](/docs/editors/cursor) - Full integration with cursor rules and MCP

## What are Editor Rules?

Editor rules are configuration files that help AI assistants understand your project context and provide better suggestions. They ensure:

- **Consistent code style** across your team
- **Project-specific patterns** are followed
- **Latest documentation** is always used
- **Security best practices** are enforced

## Quick Setup

For most editors, you'll need to:

1. **Install the MCP extension** (if required)

3. **Add project rules** for Web3 development
