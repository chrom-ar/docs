# Development Workflow

Learn the optimal workflow for developing Web3 applications with Spark A1, from initial setup to mainnet deployment.

## Overview

The Spark A1 development workflow emphasizes:
- **Iterative development** with real-time feedback
- **Security-first** approach with automated scanning
- **Test-driven development** for reliability
- **Gas optimization** throughout the process

## Project Setup

### Choose Your Development Framework

Select a framework that suits your needs:

- **Hardhat** - Full-featured development environment with built-in testing
- **Foundry** - Fast, portable, and modular toolkit written in Rust
- **Truffle** - Mature framework with extensive tooling

### Configure Spark A1

Set up your editor with Spark A1 as shown in the [Editor Setup guide](/docs/editors) to get intelligent code assistance throughout your development.

## Development Cycle

### Phase 1: Contract Design

1. **Define Requirements**
   - List contract functionalities and features
   - Identify user roles and permissions
   - Document state variables and events

2. **Architecture Planning**
   - Choose appropriate design patterns (Factory, Proxy, etc.)
   - Plan contract interactions and dependencies
   - Consider upgradability requirements

3. **Security Considerations**
   - Identify potential attack vectors
   - Plan access control mechanisms
   - Design emergency pause functionality

### Phase 2: Implementation

As you write your smart contracts, Spark A1 provides:
- **Real-time syntax validation** and auto-completion
- **Security warnings** for common vulnerabilities
- **Gas optimization** suggestions
- **Best practice** recommendations based on latest standards

### Phase 3: Testing

Comprehensive testing should include:
- **Unit Tests** - Test individual functions and components
- **Integration Tests** - Verify contract interactions
- **Gas Optimization Tests** - Monitor and optimize gas consumption
- **Edge Case Testing** - Handle unexpected inputs and scenarios

### Phase 4: Security Audit

Spark A1 automatically scans for common vulnerabilities:
- Reentrancy attacks
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Unchecked return values
- Access control issues
- Front-running vulnerabilities

Always conduct a manual review before deployment to ensure all security considerations are addressed.

### Phase 5: Deployment

1. **Test on Local Network** - Verify functionality in a controlled environment
2. **Deploy to Testnet** - Test with real network conditions
3. **Verify Contracts** - Publish source code for transparency
4. **Deploy to Mainnet** - Final production deployment

## Best Practices

### Code Organization

Regardless of your framework choice, maintain a clean project structure:
- `contracts/` - Smart contract source files, organized by functionality (core, interfaces, libraries)
- `test/` - Test files, separated by type (unit, integration, gas)
- `scripts/` - Deployment and utility scripts
- `docs/` - Project documentation

### Version Control

- **Never commit sensitive data** (.env files, private keys)
- **Use semantic commit messages** (feat:, fix:, test:, docs:)
- **Maintain a clean commit history**
- **Tag releases appropriately**

### Continuous Integration

Set up automated testing and verification:
- Run tests on every push
- Check code coverage
- Verify compilation
- Lint and format checks

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Post-Deployment Monitoring

1. **Transaction Monitoring**
   - Set up alerts for unusual activity
   - Monitor gas usage patterns
   - Track transaction success rates

2. **Contract Health**
   - Monitor contract balances
   - Check for stuck transactions
   - Verify state consistency

3. **Security Monitoring**
   - Watch for suspicious patterns
   - Monitor privileged operations
   - Maintain incident response procedures

### Upgrade Strategy

Consider upgradability patterns if your protocol requires future updates:
- Proxy patterns for logic upgrades
- Migration strategies for state changes
- Emergency pause mechanisms for critical issues

## Common Patterns

### Essential Security Patterns

- **Emergency Pause** - Ability to pause critical functions in case of issues
- **Access Control** - Role-based permissions for different operations
- **Reentrancy Guards** - Protection against recursive calls
- **Time Locks** - Delayed execution for critical changes

### Gas Optimization Techniques

- **Pack Storage Variables** - Group variables to minimize storage slots
- **Use Events for Data** - Store data in events when possible
- **Batch Operations** - Process multiple operations in single transaction
- **Short-circuit Evaluation** - Order conditions by likelihood and gas cost
